Evron Dungeon Crawler:

This is my first game and project not meant for school.
I am trying to learn more about java basics and getting
more comfortable with programming as a whole and its quirks.

Plans:
- add more actions. if player moves into "this" and its _____
then do this action or prompt user with "this"
- add the combat system
- add the weapons and armor systems 
- add the damage and defense calculations into the game
- add title screen to the game
- add xp and level up system like dark souls kinda
- add gold functionality, shops, merchants, etc.
- add full loot system, wide variety of loot, sets, etc.
- add set bonuses, special items, special weapons etc.
- add equipment functionality like potions or throwing knives
- add gem system where gems can be slotted into armor and weapons
- add dungeons, full base town home area
- either add wide dungeon variety or add a full "open world"

distant future plans:
- add a full gui for the game
- read and write game data
- add basic ai generated textures
